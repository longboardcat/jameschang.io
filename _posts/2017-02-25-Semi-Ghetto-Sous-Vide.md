I am much better at writing Chef than being a chef. This needs to change. This post talks about what
my setup is for cooking sous vide and why I chose to focus on this method.

## Sous Vide

Sous vide is a method of cooking food in vacuum-sealed bags in a temperature-controlled water
bath. Precise temperatures prevent overcooking, and exact cooking times allow the chef to cook
reproducible meals. Until the last few years, only food labs and high-end restaurants could afford
to take advantage of and experiment with this technique, but [ghetto sous vide][0],
[dishwasher salmon][1], and household sous vide cookers exist now. Sous vide is my
formal introduction to cooking because it's great to start with an already-reliable
system that also happens to make delicious food.

## Setup

- [Anova Precision Cooker][2], $150
- [Igloo Island Breeze Cooler][3], $15
- [Ziploc Freezer Gallon Bags][4]

## Bagging

I haven't encountered a cook where vacuum sealing was necessary. Freezer bags are sufficiently
sealed if you use the water submersion method:

1. Fill the bag with food.
2. Zip the bag 75% of the way.
3. Squeeze air out by hand.
4. Submerge the bag into the water with the unzipped 25% poking out into the air. Use a spoon to
make sure the bag stays submerged if the water's hot.
5. Close the remaining 25% of the bag.
6. Place the bag's opening above the water and smooth it out to make sure it's completely sealed.

## Temperatures

| Food       | Temperature           |
|:----------:|:---------------------:|
| Chicken    | 140&deg;F - 165&deg;F |
| Beef Steak | 130&deg;F - 155&deg;F |
| Fish       | 105&deg;F -130&deg;F  |
| Pork       | 135&deg;F - 155&deg;F |
| Veggies    | 180&deg;F - 185&deg;F |
