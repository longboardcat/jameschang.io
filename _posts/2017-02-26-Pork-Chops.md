What pork should be. Total cook time: 1-4 hours.

## Ingredients

- Boneless loin pork chops, 1-1.5 inches thick
- Salt
- Pepper
- Neutral cooking oil

Haven't had much success with rib chops. Thicker boneless chops or center-cut chops are more
suitable for sous vide than their thinner counterparts. Boneless chops also contain less fat. If
you dislike that... stay tuned for pork belly.

## Preparation

1. Heat the sous vide cooker to 144&deg;F.
2. Pat each side of the pork chops with salt, including the edges. **The thicker the cut, the more
salt you can afford to add. Thinner cuts require a thin coat of salt.**
    1. With a thin coat of salt, the pork will feel smooth with some occasional bumps.
    2. With a thick coat of salt, the pork will feel coarse.
    3. With too much salt, the pork will feel like sandpaper.
3. Following the same rules but with a lower amount, apply pepper to all sides of the chop.
4. Bag the chops with with oil. I generally add enough oil to cover the length of the bag's bottom.
5. Add any combination of garlic, butter, shallots/onions, herbs, etc.
6. **Massage the bag to ensure an even coating of ingredients**. Let each chop lay flat without
covering other chops.
7. Seal the bag and cook at 144&deg;F for 1-4 hours.

## Finishing

1. Ten minutes prior to removing the pork chops from the water bath, bring a pan to high heat.
2. Remove the chops from the bag and pat them dry with paper towels. Keep the juices in the bag, and
optionally discard the other ingredients.
3. Sear the chops with oil or butter until browned. Sear the edges as well.
4. Plate the pork chops.
5. Heat the juices and other remaining ingredients and pour over the chops.
