*Hey, I'm good. Just like last game.*

## Foreward
Secret Hitler is one of my favorite games. It has a wonderful balance of asymmetry and hidden roles. The Liberals have the majority, but the Fascists have the information, and the Secret Hitler needs that information. I've had the fortune of being Fascist for an overwhelming number of games I've played with my friends, so I am somewhat qualified to talk about this.

### Terminology
1. Playing **Fascist** is the same as playing **red** and being **bad**.
2. Playing **Liberal** is the same as playing **blue** and being **good**.
3. **Signaling** is the act of showing Hitler you're on the same side, or showing other Fascists to Hitler.
4. Being **safe** means that player is not Hitler after three Fascist policies have been passed.
5. **Winformation** is this stupid term I made up minutes ago to mean saying shit that just makes absolute sense. Statements that nobody can disagree with. This is not synonymous with trust, but many newer players form trust when listening to correct statements.

### How Fascists Win
There are three main ways Fascists win. The common goal is to elect Hitler, achieving 6/6 Fascist policies is much more difficult.

#### 1. Converting One Liberal
Fascists *signal* to Hitler early, form a majority of winformation with one other Liberal player. The other Liberals have a difficulty swaying their lost ally because they don't know who it is, and this ally can be easily framed.

#### 2. Confusing All Liberals
Fascists rope in Liberals but force them to play red policies by discarding blue policies as President. Fewer blue policies are played, and the Liberals have less information when the **Special Election** happens. The Special Election is the turning point of the game. If the third policy goes red, the President chooses the next President that will have the power to kill.

Fascists stall the votes until this can be guaranteed and then kill a Liberal. This usually wins most games with odd # of players.

#### 3. Endgame Election Paranoia
It's near the end of the game. The Liberals have more policies and the Fascists are down. In addition, the Liberals have a small coalition (min 3) that controls votes and elects each other. The Fascists must use the paranoia of electing Hitler to destroy the Liberal's winformation.

Before we move on, always **consider the consequences of your actions**.

### Signaling, or playing with Hitler
Hitler needs to know early on who's on his side, ideally before the Special Election. If all the Fascists are sitting close together near the end of the turn cycle, you need to stall the vote as much as possible until one of you can signal. Note: Don't be a troll and force Hitler to play red when there are 4/5 Liberal policies on the board :)

#### Hitler/You are President/Chancellor
1. Hitler most likely passes you one of each to test your allegiance.
2. You play red and frown.
3. Wait for Hitler to say, "I passed two reds".

#### Hitler/You are Chancellor/President
1. You pass Hitler one of each.
2. Hitler plays blue.
3. You immediately say, "I passed him two blues".

1. You pass Hitler two blues.
2. Hitler plays blue.
3. You immediately say, "I passed him one of each".

#### Role Card Inspection
You inspect Hitler and say he's good.

### Fascist Roles

#### **You're Secret Hitler**
Womp womp, you don't know who's on your team. Await further signaling.

#### Voting
When there are 4/5 Liberal policies on the board, be cognizant of the vote. Never let a Liberal force you to play red on match point. Stall the vote as hard as possible to prevent a loss.

#### Playing President as Hitler
You can discard or pass blue cards as President.

If you discard blue cards, you will draw more suspicion to yourself, but the upside is you appear more regular Fascist and less Hitler.

If you choose not to discard blue cards, you may be giving Liberals easy blue policies, but you'll cast less suspicion on yourself. This is the typical way to play.

#### Sacrificing Teammates
Sometimes your teammates are suspicious and you can't save them. Feel free to out them and demote them to the Fall Guy (see below).

#### Spreading Misinformation
Lastly, play your part in destroying the Liberal's winformation by spreading paranoia about the dangers of choosing Hitler as Chancellor.

#### The Fall Guy
In order to win, you must first not lose. My first games often ended with Liberals quickly getting 4/5 blue policies on the board and then winning soon after. This first strategy was played as a response.

Someone on your team needs to be playing red and drawing suspicion away from Hitler and to themselves.
1.You don't need to pick conflicts to be suspicious. Being wary and mistrustful works.
2.Be eager to become Chancellor, especially if there's existing pressure on Hitler. You'll look like Hitler and probably be shot but...
3.Try to die by purposely playing red at gunpoint. Before you die, tell everyone you know the person playing Hitler is bad and a Liberal player is good.
4.You can always shoot yourself to make a point.

#### The Preacher
You make shit up that makes sense. You're the supplier of fake winformation.
1.If your Hitler player has undeniable suspicion, prepare to convince the crowd that he's a regular Fascist because Hitler wouldn't be so suspicious early on. Argue that it's better to pick your Hitler player as Chancellor or to kill another player, because there's a high chance they're bad, but safe.
2.Do the same for the fall guy, make sure he's wrong and appears as suspicious as possible to further establish your own credibility.

#### The Known Unknown
If you're one of the last players in the circle, you can try preventing any information gathering of yourself. Don't volunteer for Chancellor and stay unknown until the end of the game. This confuses the Liberals and is the opposite of how a cookie cutter Fascist player plays.
